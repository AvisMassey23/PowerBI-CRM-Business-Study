## 🚀 **Key Features & Findings**
### **1️⃣ Balanced Scorecard Framework**
We implemented a **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)** to measure **financial, customer, internal process, and growth perspectives** for Cyclistic, helping track key business objectives.

### **2️⃣ GAP Analysis**
By comparing the **current vs. desired state**, we identified critical areas needing improvement, such as:
- 📉 **Limited customer engagement** due to lack of targeted communication.  
- 🏪 **No designated service centers** for bike maintenance.  
- 📊 **Data silos**—manual data tracking using Excel, leading to inefficiencies.  
- 🚲 **Lower female customer engagement**, requiring targeted marketing efforts.

### **3️⃣ Business Intelligence with Power BI**
Developed **interactive dashboards** to visualize:
- 🏆 **Most popular bike stations** and trip patterns.  
- 📆 **Seasonal trends**—higher summer ridership, lower winter engagement.  
- 📊 **Customer segmentation**—casual riders vs. annual members.  
- 🏷️ **Revenue tracking and operational efficiency**.

### **4️⃣ CRM Implementation (Monday.com)**
To streamline customer service & sales:
- **Lead management system** to track potential customers.  
- **Customer service dashboards** to monitor and resolve support queries.  
- **Automated marketing campaigns** to convert casual riders into annual subscribers.
